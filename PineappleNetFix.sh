# tldr; Fixes problem where host loses network connection and gives
# the Pineapple an Internet connection though the host.
# 
# Long Version: The Hak5 Wifi Pineapplle has a known issue where when it's connected
# to a host via the USB interface, it will kill the network connection 
# on the host it was connected to. This is becuase the Pineapple becomes
# the default gateway for the host. This script fixes this issue while
# also allowing the Pineapple to connect to the internet via the host
# it's attached to.
